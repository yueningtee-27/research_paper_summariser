**Machine Learning and Data Mining in Healthcare: A Review**

This review aims to provide an overview of the applications of machine learning and data mining techniques in healthcare. The increasing availability of electronic health records (EHRs) and other healthcare-related data has created opportunities for researchers to develop predictive models that can improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, and enhance decision-making.

**Applications of Machine Learning in Healthcare**

Machine learning has been applied in various areas of healthcare, including:

* **Disease diagnosis**: Machine learning algorithms have been used to classify patients with breast cancer (Wu et al., 2021), liver disease (Fathi et al., 2020), and diabetes (Maniruzzaman et al., 2020).
* **Patient length of stay prediction**: Researchers have developed models to predict patient length of stay in emergency departments (Gurazada et al., 2022) and intensive care units (Alabbad et al., 2022).
* **Emergency department visits forecasting**: Machine learning algorithms have been used to forecast emergency department visits (Sahai et al., 2020; Rustam et al., 2020).

**Data Mining in Healthcare**

Data mining techniques have been applied in various areas of healthcare, including:

* **Patient classification**: Researchers have developed models to classify patients with chronic liver disease (Amin et al., 2023) and breast cancer (Sultana et al., 2022).
* **Disease prediction**: Machine learning algorithms have been used to predict the risk of developing diseases such as diabetes (Maniruzzaman et al., 2020) and stroke (Badriyah et al., 2020).
