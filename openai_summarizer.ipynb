Results showed the need for establishing more beds in the Heart ward from 26 to 137 in 2027. In addition, more considerations on the child Heart patients' treatment and the increasing trend of the occurring Heart diseases among younger people are recommended by results. This paper only focused on HBC forecasting and paid no attention to other required resources such as Specialists, Nurses, Equipment, and Budget. Forecasting these significant factors could provide beneficial information for decision-makers. In addition, some other factors can affect the NHP of a hospital in the future, such as insurance service level, the accessibility to other hospitals, the service quality level, limits on the number of available corresponding specialists, the number of specialized equipment, the economic conditions, and the people's accessibility to periodic checkup. This needs to use multivariate time series data sets and multivariate ML tools in future works. Also, uncertainty is an inevitable fact in decision-making that could be mentioned in the future use of DA, ML, and DL for HBC forecasting.\", 'page_start': None}, {'heading': 'Ethical statement', 'content': 'Ethical statement The Authors declare that no real clinical data is applied in this paper.', 'page_start': None}]\n",

       "\"# Summary of Research on Hospital Bed Capacity Forecasting\\n\\n## Introduction\\nThe forecasting of Hospital Bed Capacity (HBC) is increasingly recognized as a critical factor influencing hospital sustainability, economic efficiency, and patient satisfaction. Accurate HBC forecasting is essential for optimizing resource allocation and enhancing healthcare delivery. This research underscores the multifaceted impact of HBC forecasting, highlighting its relevance in contemporary healthcare management.\\n\\n## Literature Review\\nThe existing literature emphasizes the importance of effective bed capacity management, particularly in emergency departments, to improve service quality. Key studies, such as those by Bachouch et al. (2012), Devapriya et al. (2015), and Keegan et al. (2018), illustrate the emergency department's role as the initial point of patient care. Additionally, Nas and Koyuncu (2019) employed machine learning tools to predict patient arrival rates and optimize bed requirements in Turkey, focusing on minimizing Length of Stay (LOS). The urgency of predicting hospital ward capacity during pandemics, notably COVID-19, is highlighted by Deschepper et al. (2021) and Haghshenas et al. (2021). The reviewed literature, summarized in Table 1, indicates a growing emphasis on predictive analytics in healthcare capacity management.\\n\\n## Methodology\\n### Hybrid Data-Driven Approach\\nThis research proposes a hybrid data-driven framework for HBC forecasting, integrating traditional statistical methods with machine learning techniques to enhance predictive accuracy. The methodology emphasizes the importance of utilizing diverse datasets, although specific datasets are not detailed. Preliminary experiments suggest that this hybrid approach yields more reliable HBC forecasts compared to conventional methods.\\n\\n### New Framework for HBC Forecasting\\nThe proposed framework focuses on critical factors such as LOS and the Number of Hospitalizations per patient (NHP) in predicting bed requirements. Initial analyses of these factors, along with patient age and bed occupancy, provide insights into the forecasting problem. The framework employs a straightforward mathematical model to project future bed needs based on these analyses.\\n\\n### Data Collection and Analysis\\nThe dataset comprises 51,231 records collected from 2011 to 2018, focusing on features relevant to forecasting bed capacity in the Heart ward. After data cleaning, 47,605 records were retained, with 70% allocated for training and 30% for testing. The analysis examines the relationship between NHP, patient age distribution, and LOS, ultimately determining a required bed capacity of 25. Various data analysis techniques are employed to explore these critical factors.\\n\\n## Results\\n### Heart Ward Bed Capacity Forecasting\\nA mathematical model for predicting heart ward bed capacity is presented, incorporating current and historical patient data to forecast future needs over a 1825-day period. The model aggregates patient numbers across different categories, enhancing the accuracy of bed capacity predictions.\\n\\n### Managerial Insights\\nThe analysis reveals mismanagement issues regarding bed utilization in the Heart ward, particularly during the Persian New Year holidays. Recommendations include implementing managerial strategies and cultural initiatives to ensure equitable shift scheduling for specialists, thereby preventing empty beds and enhancing the sustainable capacity of Heart beds.\\n\\n## Discussion\\nThe findings indicate a significant increase in required beds, projecting a rise from 26 to 137 by 2027. The study emphasizes the need for a greater focus on treating child heart patients and addressing the rising incidence of heart diseases among younger demographics. However, the research is limited to HBC forecasting and does not account for other critical resources such as specialists, nurses, and equipment, which are essential for comprehensive decision-making.\\n\\n## Conclusions, Limitations, and Recommendations\\nThis research presents a data-driven methodology that overcomes the limitations of traditional forecasting models. Future studies should incorporate additional factors influencing hospital performance, including insurance service levels, hospital accessibility, and economic conditions. The authors recommend employing multivariate time series datasets and advanced multivariate machine learning techniques in subsequent research. They also acknowledge the inherent uncertainty in decision-making processes and suggest that future applications of data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning in HBC forecasting should address this aspect.\\n\\n## Ethical Statement\\nThe authors affirm that the research does not utilize any real clinical data, ensuring that no datasets, results, or experiments involving actual clinical information are included in the study.\""
