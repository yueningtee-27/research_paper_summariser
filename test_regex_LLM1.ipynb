These considerations shed light on the mul tifaceted nature of \\nFigure 5. Accuracy of machine learning models on both datasets.\\nAcross both datasets, these models consistently demonstrate exceptional performance,\\nemphasizing their efficacy in heart disease prediction. Notably, the XGBoost model stands\\nout with an impressive accuracy rate of 98.50% in the Cardiovascular Heart Disease Dataset,\\nwhile the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model achieves a commendable accuracy of 91.80%\\nDiagnostics 2024, 14, 144 16 of 19\\nin the Heart Disease Cleveland Dataset. These high levels of accuracy emphasize the\\nmodels’ reliability, positioning them as valuable tools for diagnosing heart disease.\\nPrecision, a critical metric in healthcare, reflects the models’ ability to identify heart\\ndisease cases precisely. Both models achieve outstanding precision, with the XGBoost\\nmodel leading at 99.14%, closely followed by the KNN model at 96.55%. These elevated\\nprecision levels significantly reduce the occurrence of false positive diagnoses, alleviating\\nunnecessary concerns for patients.\\nFurthermore, the F1 Score, which balances precision and recall, highlights the XGBoost\\nmodel’s effectiveness in recognizing heart disease cases while minimizing the risk of\\noverlooking positive instances. The model achieves F1 Scores of 98.71% and 91.80% in both\\ndatasets, showcasing its ability to strike this delicate balance effectively.\\n6. Conclusions and Future Scope\\nAs we discussed the broader scope of model selection and its implications for heart\\ndisease prediction, the conducted analysis has unearthed invaluable insights. Among the\\narray of models under scrutiny, K-Nearest Neighbors and XGBoost have consistently risen\\nto prominence as top-performing candidates across both datasets, as shown below. These\\nmodels have exhibited remarkable accuracy and recall scores, rendering them robust con-\\ntenders for the precise classification of heart disease. It is noteworthy, however, that other\\nmodels, including Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network, Gradient Boost,\\nRandom Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), have showcased significant\\npredictive capabilities once their hyperparameters were meticulously tuned. In this diverse\\nensemble, XGBoost emerges as a standout performer, marked by its exceptional accuracy\\nand recall scores, coupled with a harmoniously balanced F1 Score and precision on the\\nCardiovascular Heart Disease Dataset. This points out XGBoost’s transformative potential\\nin the realm of heart disease prediction and diagnosis, positioning it as an invaluable tool\\nfor healthcare professionals. The model instills a high level of confidence in identifying\\npotential cases of heart disease, firmly establishing itself as an exemplary choice within this\\ndataset. The exceptional precision and accuracy exhibited by these models bear profound\\nimplications for the diagnosis and care of individuals with heart disease. Such precision not\\nonly enhances diagnostic accuracy but also opens new avenues for interventions and treat-\\nments that can be initiated with heightened confidence. In the quest for the most suitable\\nmodel, it is imperative to align the selection with the specific requirements and constraints\\nof the application at hand. Practical considerations such as interpretability, computational\\ncomplexity, and data availability should guide the decision-making process, ensuring that\\nthe chosen model is tailored to meet the unique needs of the task. These findings culminate\\nin a valuable resource that can empower informed decision-making within the realm of\\nheart disease prediction, particularly in clinical settings. The potential to revolutionize\\nheart disease diagnosis and patient care is emphasized, further cementing the significance\\nof machine learning in the field of healthcare. In practical terms, this implies that when the\\nmodel indicates an individual as having heart disease, the likelihood of accuracy is notably\\nhigh, signifying a significant advancement in the landscape of medical diagnostics. Future\\ndirections for this study could involve expanding the scope by incorporating more exten-\\nsive medical imaging datasets. Leveraging such data could enhance image-based heart\\ndisease prediction, potentially leading to even more accurate and robust diagnostic tools\\nin the field of cardiovascular health. Furthermore, exploring ensemble models that merge\\nthe strengths of multiple algorithms may offer promising avenues for further improving\\npredictive accuracy in the field of heart disease prediction. These considerations shed\\nlight on the multifaceted nature of heart disease prediction research, emphasizing the need\\nfor ongoing refinement and innovation in this critical domain. Future research directions\\nshould also prioritize the refinement of models and expansion of datasets. In contrast\\nto [42,43], our study employs a distinct dataset, leveraging its unique characteristics to\\nenhance the robustness and generalizability of the models. Furthermore, the selection\\nof machine learning models in our work deviates from those used in the cited studies,\\nDiagnostics 2024, 14, 144 17 of 19\\ncontributing to the innovative aspect of our approach. Importantly, the outcomes of our\\nmodels exhibit a noteworthy improvement in predictive accuracy, establishing a superior\\nperformance benchmark.\\nThis nuanced combination of dataset, model selection, and elevated accuracy under-\\nscores the distinctive contribution of our work to the field of heart disease prediction. It\\npositions our study as an advancement beyond existing research, offering a more refined\\nand accurate predictive framework.\\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.O. and F.S.; methodology, A.O. and F.S.; software,\\nA.O.; validation, S.B., A.M.A. and S.N.Q.; formal analysis, A.O., F.S., S.B., A.M.A. and S.N.Q.;\\ninvestigation, A.O., S.B., A.M.A. and S.N.Q.; resources, S.B., A.M.A. and S.N.Q.; data curation, A.O.;\\nwriting—original draft preparation, A.O. and F.S.; writing—review and editing, A.O., F.S., S.B.,\\nA.M.A. and S.N.Q.; visualization, A.O.; supervision, F.S.; project administration, F.S. and A.M.A.;\\nfunding acquisition, A.M.A. and S.N.Q.

Introduction\\nThe heart plays a crucial role in sustaining life by effectively pumping oxygenated\\nblood and regulating important hormones to maintain optimal blood pressure levels. Any\\ndeviation from its functioning can lead to the development of heart conditions, collectively\\nknown as cardiovascular diseases (CVD). CVD includes a range of disorders that affect\\nboth the heart and blood vessels, such as cerebrovascular problems, congenital anomalies,\\npulmonary embolisms, irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias), peripheral arterial issues,\\ncoronary artery disease (CAD), rheumatic heart ailments, coronary heart disease (CHD),\\nand cardiomyopathies that affect the heart muscle.\\nNotably, CHD is the subtype among cardiovascular diseases, accounting for a signif-\\nicant 64% of all cases. While it primarily affects men, women are also susceptible to its\\nimpact. Within the realm of CVDs, CAD is particularly concerning due to its association\\nwith global mortality rates. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) [1], the\\nconsequences of CVDs are profound, with staggering statistics indicating an estimated\\n17.9 million deaths annually are attributed to these diseases worldwide. These alarming\\nnumbers highlight the significance of research efforts and medical advancements dedicated\\nDiagnostics 2024, 14, 144. https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics14020144 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/diagnostics\\nDiagnostics 2024, 14, 144 2 of 19\\nto combatting and lessening the impact of cardiovascular diseases worldwide. There are\\nrisk factors that contribute to the development of CVDs, including blood pressure, excess\\nbody weight and obesity, abnormal lipid profiles, glucose irregularities or diabetes condi-\\ntions, tobacco usage or smoking habits, physical inactivity or sedentary lifestyle, alcohol\\nconsumption, and cholesterol levels. The WHO predicts that CVD will remain a cause\\nof mortality, silently posing a substantial threat to human life for the foreseeable future,\\npossibly even beyond 2030.\\nMachine learning, as highlighted by Ramesh et al. [ 2], enjoys major transformative\\ncapability within the healthcare industry. Its outstanding advancements can be ascribed to\\nits exceptional data processing abilities, which are far superior to those of humans. Conse-\\nquently, the field of healthcare has observed the development of several AI applications that\\nleverage machine learning’s speed and accuracy, paving the way for revolutionary solutions\\nto diverse healthcare challenges. Several machine learning methods have been applied for\\nthe purpose of detecting cardiovascular diseases. However, there is still a need to enhance\\nthe predictive models and address the research gaps in the existing detection approaches,\\nsuch as the challenge of imbalanced datasets, which can lead to biased predictions.\\nBy investigating the effectiveness of hybrid models combining different techniques,\\nvarious researchers have explored diverse methodologies, including neural networks\\nand various machine learning methods, to enhance prediction accuracy [ 3–12]. While\\nthese studies provide valuable insights, the variability in datasets, models, and outcomes\\nunderscores the complexity of the predictive task. Despite the advancements, there remains\\na pressing need for further investigations to refine existing models and improve the overall\\nperformance of cardiovascular disease prediction. The diverse landscape of machine\\nlearning applications in this domain emphasizes the importance of continued research\\nto enhance the accuracy, reliability, and generalizability of predictive models, ultimately\\ncontributing to more effective clinical interventions and patient care.\\nIn this paper, we have explored the strengths and limitations of the existing machine\\nlearning (ML) techniques in the context of heart disease analysis. Then, we investigated\\nand applied seven machine learning-driven predictive models that can enhance the de-\\ntection of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases; these models include K-Nearest\\nNeighbors, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network,\\nGradient Boost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. Two datasets were used in this study, which\\nwere pre-processed using different techniques such as oversampling, feature scaling, nor-\\nmalization, and dimensionality reduction to optimize data for effective machine learning\\nanalysis. Finally, we evaluated and compared the efficacy of different machine learning\\n(ML) techniques for analyzing heart diseases within the healthcare sector.\\n2. Related Works\\nIn this paper, we present a concise technical background and review pertinent literature\\nrelated to research studies conducted on the early forecast of heart disease utilizing machine\\nlearning and deep learning techniques. We highlight the different methods that have been\\nemployed in these studies to foretell heart disease at an initial stage.\\n2.1. Machine Learning Approach\\nMachine learning remains a rapidly advancing discipline of computational algorithms\\nthat try to imitate human intelligence by learning through data and the surrounding\\nenvironment. These algorithms play a crucial role in processing and analyzing large-scale\\ndata, often referred to as “big data”. Machine learning techniques have demonstrated\\ntheir effectiveness in various domains, including pattern recognition, computer vision,\\nspacecraft engineering, as well as biomedical and medical applications. Their versatility\\nand success have made them indispensable tools in addressing complex challenges and\\nextracting valuable insights from diverse datasets [13].\\nMachine learning is a specialized approach that automates the process of model\\nbuilding. Using algorithms, machines can discover hidden patterns and insights within\\nDiagnostics 2024, 14, 144 3 of 19\\ndatasets. Importantly, in machine learning, we do not particularly instruct machines on\\nwhere to explore for insights; instead, the algorithms enable the machines to learn and\\nadapt their techniques and outputs as they uncover new-found data and scenarios. This\\niterative nature of machine learning allows for continuous improvement and adaptation,\\nmaking it a powerful tool for processing and analyzing complex datasets [14].\\nThere exist two main approaches in machine learning: supervised learning and un-\\nsupervised learning. In one approach, supervised learning, algorithms are trained using\\nspecific examples. The machine is provided with input data along with their corresponding\\ncorrect outputs. Learning takes place by comparing the machine’s experimental outcomes\\nwith the accurate outputs to discover blunders. This sort of learning is suitable after\\nprevious data has been utilized to foretell future occurrences [15].\\nThe other approach, unsupervised learning, involves the machine exploring the\\nrecords and attempting to discover patterns or structures on its own. It needs to cre-\\nate models commencing from scratch and is not provided with any precise outputs to\\nguide its learning process. Unsupervised learning is commonly employed to detect and\\ndistinguish outliers in the data. This approach is particularly useful when there is limited\\nor no labeled data available for training [14]. Researchers worldwide have made signifi-\\ncant efforts to combat cardiovascular disease (CVD) and improve patient outcomes [16].\\nThese efforts include enhancing clinical decision support systems to achieve precise early\\ndetection and enable effective treatment. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence\\n(AI) techniques have played a pivotal role in the early detection and diagnosis of CVD.\\nCVD detection encompasses different distinct approaches. The first approach involves\\nutilizing AI models that analyze various test reports to distinguish between CVD patients\\nand healthy citizens. The second approach utilizes signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG)\\nand heart sound signals as vital information for ML models to classify individuals as either\\nhealthy or having CVD [16].\\n2.2. Deep Learning Approach\\nIn recent years, there has been remarkable progress in the field of deep learning, with\\na primary focus on developing intelligent automated systems that aid doctors in predicting\\nand diagnosing diseases through the utilization of the Internet of Things (IoT). While\\nconventional machine learning techniques were often restricted by their dependency on\\nsingle datasets, the advent of deep learning has brought significant enhancements to the\\naccuracy of existing algorithms. Deep learning leverages artificial neural networks, which\\nconsist of multiple hidden layers organized in a cascading pattern. This architecture enables\\nthe processing of non-linear datasets, allowing for more complex patterns and relationships\\nto be captured and learned by the model. As a result, deep learning has emerged as a\\npowerful tool in medical applications, providing improved predictive capabilities and\\nenhancing disease diagnosis through the integration of IoT devices and data sources. This\\napproach has shown promising results, outperforming older machine learning algorithms\\nin terms of accuracy. As accurate medical support systems for detecting hidden patterns\\nand predicting diseases are still lacking, deep learning offers the potential to accurately\\npredict heart diseases at an early stage, allowing for timely intervention and treatment [17].\\nSudha and Kumar [18] observed that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is\\na suitable method for diagnosing heart disease. CNN’s ability to learn and represent\\nfeatures in a concise and conceptual manner',\n",

CNN’s ability to learn and represent\\nfeatures in a concise and conceptual manner is advantageous, especially as the network’s\\ndepth increases. Additionally, they proposed a hybrid model that combines Convolutional\\nNeural Networks (CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, which are a type\\nof recurrent neural network (RNN). LSTM units are known for their ability to store and\\ntransmit relevant information over long sequences, making them particularly useful for\\ntime-series data such as heart disease data. By integrating CNN and LSTM, the hybrid\\nmodel aimed to enhance the accuracy of heart disease classification. The CNN component\\nis adept at capturing spatial patterns in the data, while the LSTM component excels at\\nrecognizing temporal dependencies and patterns. This combination allows the model to\\nDiagnostics 2024, 14, 144 4 of 19\\neffectively learn complex features from the data, leading to improved classification accuracy.\\nExperimental results from the study revealed promising outcomes, with the hybrid model\\nachieving an accuracy of 89%, sensitivity of 81%, and specificity of 93%. These results\\noutperformed conventional machine learning classifiers, indicating the potential of the\\nproposed hybrid approach in advancing the accuracy of heart disease classification [18].\\nThe healthcare sector has emerged as a prime beneficiary of the growing volume\\nand accessibility of data [ 19]. Various entities, such as healthcare providers, pharmaco-\\nlogical firms, research institutions, and government parastatals, are now accumulating\\nvast volumes of data from diverse sources, including research, clinical trials, public health\\nprograms, and insurance data. The merging of such data holds immense potential for\\nadvancing healthcare practices and decision-making [20]. Traditionally, doctors used to\\ndiagnose and treat patients based on their symptoms alone. However, evidence-based\\nmedicine has become the prevailing approach, where physicians review extensive datasets\\nobtained from medical trials and treatment paths on a huge scale to make decisions built\\non the most comprehensive and up-to-date information available. This shift towards data-\\ndriven decision-making is transforming healthcare practices, improving patient outcomes,\\nand driving further advancements in the medical field [14].\\nNumerous industry and research initiatives are actively working on implementing\\nmachine learning expertise in the healthcare sector to enhance patient care and well-being\\nglobally. One such initiative is the Shah Lab, based at Stanford University [ 14]. The\\nShah Lab focuses on leveraging machine learning and data science to address critical\\nhealthcare challenges and develop innovative solutions for various medical applications.\\nThrough these initiatives, researchers and experts aim to harness the power of machine\\nlearning to analyze large-scale healthcare data, including electronic health records, medical\\nimaging, genomics, and patient outcomes. By extracting valuable insights and patterns\\nfrom this data, they aim to improve disease diagnosis, treatment prediction, personalized\\nmedicine, and overall patient management. The goal is to provide healthcare professionals\\nwith advanced tools and technologies that can assist them in making more accurate and\\ntimely clinical decisions, leading to better patient outcomes and an overall improvement\\nin healthcare services worldwide.

Datasets Collection and Preprocessing\\nIn their study, Algarni et al. [27] utilized a dataset of coronary artery X-ray angiography\\nimages obtained from a clinical database. These images exhibited challenging character-\\nDiagnostics 2024, 14, 144 5 of 19\\nistics, including uneven vessel thickness, complex vascular structures in the background,\\nand the presence of noise. The dataset consisted of 130 X-ray coronary angiograms, each\\nhaving a size of 300 × 300 pixels. The data was collected from the cardiology department of\\nthe Mexican Social Security Institute, and ethical approval was obtained (reference number\\nR-2019-1001-078) for the use of this medical database in heart disease diagnosis. To train\\nand evaluate their proposed model, called ASCARIS, the dataset was randomly divided\\ninto two parts: a training set containing 100 images and a test set comprising 30 images.\\nThe ASCARIS model was developed based on color, diameter, and shape features extracted\\nfrom the angiography images.\\nAl Mehedi et al. [ 28] utilized a dataset of 299 heart failure patients obtained from\\nthe Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad. The dataset\\nconsisted of 13 attributes, including features such as Age, Anemia, High Blood Pressure,\\nCreatinine Phosphokinase (CPK), Diabetes, Ejection Fraction, Sex, Serum Creatinine, Serum\\nSodium, Smoking, Time, and a target column labeled as “Death Event”, which was used\\nfor binary classification. The dataset underwent preprocessing to ensure its quality and\\nconsistency. After preprocessing, the dataset was divided into separate train and test sets\\nfor model training and evaluation. Two feature selection methods were applied to the train\\nset to identify the most relevant features for the heart failure prediction task.\\nDeepika and Seema [29] conducted a study on heart disease with datasets available\\nonline from the UCI Machine Learning Repository at the University of California, Irvine.\\nThey comprise 76 attributes, including the target property, but only 14 of these attributes\\nwere considered essential for analysis. The researchers used two specific datasets for their\\nstudy: the Cleveland Clinic Foundation dataset, with records from 303 patients, and the\\nHungarian Institute of Cardiology dataset, with records from 294 patients. Various machine\\nlearning algorithms, including Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision\\nTree (DT), and Artificial Neural Networks, were employed in the analysis to predict heart\\ndisease.

The review also examined discussions regarding the implementation of data pre-\\nprocessing techniques, feature selection methods, and performance evaluation metrics to\\noptimize the efficiency of predictive models. Some studies underscored the importance of\\ndata quality and the relevance of specific features in enhancing the accuracy of the models.\\nMachine learning algorithms play a crucial role in precisely foretelling heart disease by\\ndiscovering suppressed patterns in data, making predictions, and improving performance\\nbased on historical data.

In contrast\\nto [42,43], our study employs a distinct dataset, leveraging its unique characteristics to\\nenhance the robustness and generalizability of the models. Furthermore, the selection\\nof machine learning models in our work deviates from those used in the cited studies,\\nDiagnostics 2024, 14, 144 17 of 19\\ncontributing to the innovative aspect of our approach. Importantly, the outcomes of our\\nmodels exhibit a noteworthy improvement in predictive accuracy, establishing a superior\\nperformance benchmark.\\nThis nuanced combination of dataset, model selection, and elevated accuracy under-\\nscores the distinctive contribution of our work to the field of heart disease prediction. It\\npositions our study as an advancement beyond existing research, offering a more refined\\nand accurate predictive framework.\\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.O. and F.S.; methodology, A.O. and F.S.; software,\\nA.O.; validation, S.B., A.M.A. and S.N.Q.; formal analysis, A.O., F.S., S.B., A.M.A. and S.N.Q.;\\ninvestigation, A.O., S.B., A.M.A. and S.N.Q.; resources, S.B., A.M.A. and S.N.Q.; data curation, A.O.;\\nwriting—original draft preparation, A.O. and F.S.; writing—review and editing, A.O., F.S., S.B.,\\nA.M.A. and S.N.Q.; visualization, A.O.; supervision, F.S.; project administration, F.S. and A.M.A.;\\nfunding acquisition, A.M.A. and S.N.Q.
